Note: this branch is uploaded onto our deployment machine and unpacked in
the same place the lastpage-server branch is unpacked. So be careful not to
clobber anything!  (That's the reason this file is called README.deploy.)

And yes, of course that's a sub-optimal approach. Packaging and properly
installing lastpage-server is non-trivial, AFAICT.

To create the lastpage user on the deploy machine:

$ sudo adduser --home /srv/lastpage --disabled-password --disabled-login lastpage
